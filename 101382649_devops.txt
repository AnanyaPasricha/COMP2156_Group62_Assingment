DevOps (a portmanteau of “development” and “operations”) is the combination of practices and tools designed to increase an organization's ability to deliver applications and services faster than traditional software development processes.

Faster, better product delivery.
Faster issue resolution and reduced complexity.

 A DevOps methodology can be difficult and costly to implement, adoption might spark organizational resistance, and the business might struggle to measure the success of its DevOps initiative.
